Just a repository

Hi! My name Joseph I am 15 years old I have a little understanding of how coding works so that makes a begineers. Im in grade 10 in my first semester(almost done) Ive been taking computer science so I know how to code to a certain level. I found out about github when a student from University of Waterloo came in to do a presentation about his expiriences in Waterloo, he gave us tips on how and where to go to practice, and view other people's code which was github. I've made a github account to practice, learn, and see what others made. Im on my journey to becoming an expert(fyi long-term goal) I am looking forward to learn here on this website.
